## VestaCp and Laravel PHP Framework

This project is aimed at administration of web hosting servers that use VestaCP platform using .NET Framework 5.2 Laravel as administrator panel. We are at an early stage with the creation of the master management levels, reseller and end user.

The idea is that we can create various resale and domain on multiple servers, in case of failure is not affected every field of a certain resale.

Inciais pending tasks:
- Add resale with encrypted password and password change

STATUS: (in progress) more updates soon
Current version 0.1

After cloning project, command "php artisan update" to install all dependencies

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
